# SpringBoard_exploratory_data_analysis

This repo includes three different EDA projects: 

__1. Body temperature analysis__

__2. Racial discrimination analysis__

__3. Hospital readmission analysis__


__Body temperature analysis__

The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37$^{\circ}$C or 98.6$^{\circ}$F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct? In this exercise, a dataset of human body temperatures was analyzed and different hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance were assessed.

__Racial discrimination analysis__

Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers. In this exercise, statistical analysis was performed to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.

__Hospital readmission analysis__
