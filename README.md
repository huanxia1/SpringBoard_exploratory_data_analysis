# SpringBoard_exploratory_data_analysis

This repo includes three different EDA projects: 

__1. Body temperature analysis__

__2. Racial discrimination analysis__

__3. Hospital readmission analysis__


__Body temperature analysis__
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37$^{\circ}$C or 98.6$^{\circ}$F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct? In this exercise, a dataset of human body temperatures was analyzed and different hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance were assessed.

__Racial discrimination analysis__
Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers. In this exercise, statistical analysis was performed to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.

__Hospital readmission analysis__
In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions. In this exercise, review and critique of a preliminary analysis of readmissions data was performed, and a statistically sound analysis for reducing the readmissions rate was constructed.
