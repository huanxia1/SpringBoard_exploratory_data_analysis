# SpringBoard_exploratory_data_analysis

This repo includes three different EDA projects: 
__1. Body temperature analysis__
__2. Racial discrimination analysis__
__3. Hospital readmission analysis__

__Body temperature analysis__
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37$^{\circ}$C or 98.6$^{\circ}$F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct? In this exercise, a dataset of human body temperatures was analyzed and different hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance were assessed.

__Racial discrimination analysis__
